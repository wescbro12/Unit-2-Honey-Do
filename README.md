**Getting Started**


**Next Steps**
For future deployment of this app, I would like to be able to have the tools created and selected on the Tools page linked to each individual project.
I would also like to have a progress bar that is associated with a pre-set of standard tasks.
Last but not least, I would like be able to upload pictures to the app so that you can track the progress of your project visually. Who doesn't love a before and after pic?
